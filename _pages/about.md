Hi! I'm **Qilong (Alex) Zhao**, an M.S. student in Computer Science at **Emory University**. I am advised by **Prof. Liang Zhao** (Emory) and collaborate with **Prof. Biwei Huang** and **Dr. Fan Feng** (UCSD).

My research focuses on **world models**, **vision–language models**, and **medical imaging**, with a consistent interest in **interpretability** and understanding how models represent and reason about the world.

## 🎯 PhD Applications  
**I am actively seeking PhD positions for Fall 2026** in areas related to  
**world models, representation learning, interpretability, and decision-making.**
