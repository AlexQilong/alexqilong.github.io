## About

I am an M.S. student in Computer Science at Emory University.  
I am advised by **Prof. Liang Zhao** (Emory) and collaborate with **Prof. Biwei Huang** and **Dr. Fan Feng** at UCSD.

My research studies **world models**, **vision–language models**, and **3D medical imaging**, with a unifying emphasis on **interpretability**—how learned representations support reasoning, prediction, and decision-making.


> **PhD applications (Fall 2026).**  
> I am actively seeking PhD positions in world models, representation learning, interpretability, and decision-making systems.
